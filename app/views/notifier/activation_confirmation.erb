Thanks for helping us with the move to the new system!

From now on, you will place your Soul Food Farm CSA orders through EggBasket.  The next few deliveries are in the system and ready for you to order.

Orders go through this cycle:

 - OPEN - Ready for you to place your order!  Orders close at 4 pm the Saturday preceding the Wednesday delivery. You can log in and view/edit/cancel your order anytime up until then.

 - IN PROGRESS - No new orders while the birds go to the slaughterhouse, get picked up, and are packed along with other items for the delivery.

 - FINALIZED - We've collected the goods, packed and weighed everything on the Wednesday of delivery, and have your final total -- usually Wednesday by midday. This is when we calculate your final order price -- the real one, not the estimated one -- and deduct the bag total from your account.  You'll get an email on the pickup day with what your order came to, your remaining balance or amount owed, and a reminder of pickup address and hours.

We may send out other emails, reminding you on Friday that an order is about to close Saturday or nudging you Tuesday to make sure you remember to pick up Wednesday.

You can log in anytime to see your current balance and order history from January onward. If you think we have imported the data incorrectly, you can check it against the old GDocs Member Pament & Order History form.

We hope you find this easier to use than the old system. Please give us feedback via the Feedback link in the system, or by emailing csa@soulfoodfarm.com

Thanks!
