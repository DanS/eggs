<%= @user.member.first_name %>,

Thanks for helping us with the move to the new system!

From now on, you will place your <%= @farm.name %> CSA orders through EggBasket.  If the upcoming delivery isn't in the system yet, it will be soon! We'll contact you either through this system or the Google Groups with more info about upcoming deliveries.

Your EggBasket:

Orders go through this cycle:

 - OPEN - Ready for you to place your order!  Orders will close Sunday morning at noon preceding the Wednesday delivery. You can log in and view/edit/cancel your order any time up until then.

 - IN PROGRESS -  No new orders or edits while we are printing the labels and packing the orders.

 - FINALIZED - Your bags are packed Tuesday or very early Wednesday morning -- that's when items are weighed and the totals calculated. This is when we calculate your final order price -- the real one, not the estimated one -- and deduct the bag total from your account.  You'll get an email on the pickup day with what your order came to, your remaining balance or amount owed, and a reminder of pickup address and hours.

We may send out other emails, nudging you Tuesday to make sure you remember to pick up Wednesday.

You can log in anytime to see your current balance and order history from this point forward. 

We hope you find this easier to use than the old system. Please give us feedback via the Feedback link in the system, or by emailing <%= @farm.contact_email %>

Thanks!
