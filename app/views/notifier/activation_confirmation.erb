Thanks for helping us with the move to the new system!

From now on, you will place your Soul Food Farm CSA orders through EggBasket.  We'll set them up as soon as we have an idea of inventory.

EggBasket:
http://soulfood.eggbasket.org

Orders go through this cycle:

 - OPEN - Ready for you to place your order!

 - IN PROGRESS - No new orders while we prepare the delivery.

 - FINALIZED - We've collected the goods and weighed everything, and have your final total.
This is when we calculate your final order total and deduct your account.  You'll get an email on the pickup day with your exact order amount, your balance or how much you owe, and when and where to pick up.


We may send out other emails, reminding you to place an order before closing or to pick up on an upcoming day.

You can log in anytime to see your current balance and order history.

Hope you enjoy!
