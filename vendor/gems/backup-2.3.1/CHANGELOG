FIXED A CRUCIAL BUG

MAJOR RELEASE
=== 2.0.0 ====================================

  - Should be a lot more backwards compatible with every update I do.
  - Does not depend on the separate local SQLite3 file any longer.
  - Will provide a db migration file for your Rails Application to store backup record data in.
  - Does not use YAML files to do configuration any longer.
  - Uses a SINGLE ruby file for "all" configuration (config/backup.rb) using elegant block notations!
  - Uses a SINGLE rake task to handle the initialization of any backup setting.
  - Can now configure an unlimited amount of customizable backup settings and run them each "individually"!
  - HIGHLY IMPROVED USABILITY!
